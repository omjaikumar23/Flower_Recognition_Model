# Flower_Recognition_Model
Project Overview:
<br>
This project implements a deep learning model for flower recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model can classify various species of flowers from input images with high accuracy.
<br>

Technologies Used:
<br>
<br>
Core Technologies - 
<br>
Python: Primary programming language
<br>
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework for building and training the CNN
<br>
OpenCV: For image preprocessing
<br>
Pillow (PIL): For image manipulation
<br>
NumPy: For numerical operations
<br>
Pandas: For data handling (if using CSV metadata)
<br>
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualization of results
<br>
<br>
#Model Architecture
The CNN architecture includes:
<br>
Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation
<br>
Max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
<br>
Dropout layers for regularization
<br>
Fully connected layers for classification
<br>
Softmax output layer for multi-class prediction
<br>
<br>
<br>
Data Preparation
<br>
Image augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming) for better generalization
<br>
Normalization (pixel values scaled to [0,1] or standardized)
<br>
Train/validation/test split (typically 70/15/15 or similar)
